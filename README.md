##### Extra game icons for the [Hatter](https://github.com/Mibea/Hatter) Icon Theme, because i care too much about theme/UI consistency
---
### How to apply:
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/lukSiBr/games-hatter/releases/latest)
2. Extract, select and copy all of it's files to `/apps/scalable` in your Hatter folder (by default, `~/.local/share/icons/Hatter/apps/scalable`) 
3. Now run the following command in your terminal to update the icon cache:
```
gtk-update-icon-cache ~/.local/share/icons/Hatter -f
```
`~/.local/share/icons/Hatter` is only the default value, it may be different depending of how you installed Hatter.
